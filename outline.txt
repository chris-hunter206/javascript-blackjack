Blackjack javascript project outline

   This program will simulate a basic game of blackjack. implementation details:

   - One player will play against the dealer
   - The game will use a single deck of cards. When the cards are mostly used
     up, the discarded cards will be re-used, and the deck re-shuffled.
   - Player starts with 500 chips.
   - Bets need to be multiples of 10 (otherwise blackjack payouts may turn
     into fractions, which doesn't make sense for chips)
   - Player can double down their bet, if their initial card total is 9, 10, or 11.
     If they choose to double down, they will only recieve one more card
   - If the dealer has an ace or ten-card showing, they will check their face
     down card to see if they have blackjack. If they do, it will be revealed
     immediately, and players who don't also have blackjack will lose their
     bet
   - Some traditional blackjack features, like splitting pairs or insurance have
     not been implemented, as they require greatly increasing complexity.

The project uses three classes:

Card: describes attributes for an individual card
    --------------
    +face: string
    +suit: string
    +value: number
    +shown: boolean
    --------------
    +hideCard(): void
    +showCard(): void
    +toString(): string

Deck: describes a collection of 52 unique Card objects
    --------------
    +cards: Card[]
    --------------
    +shuffle(): void
    +getCard(): Card

Hand: describes a collection of Card objects that have been removed from the deck and dealt to a player
    --------------
    +name: string
    +bet: number
    +stands: boolean
    +status: string
    +cards: Card[]
    --------------
    +addCard(Card): void
    +getTotal(): number
    +setStatus(string): void
    +displayCards(): string
    +toString(): string

Additional non-class methods:
    getInput(string): string
    whoWon(string, number): console output
    showCards(string, Card[]): console output

GamePlay proceeds:
1. get initial bet
2. enter main loop
3. check if deck has enough cards left
4. deal cards
5. dealer checks for blackjack
6. check player's hand for possible double down
7. player turn loop (hit or stand)
8. dealer turn loop (auto hits or stands based on count)
9. show results of hand (who won, chip totals)
10. ask for next bet or exit
